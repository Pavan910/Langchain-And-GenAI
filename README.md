## 🚀 LangChain & GenAI Projects

Welcome to my LangChain & GenAI project repository! This repo showcases my hands-on work in Generative AI, Machine Learning, and modern AI technologies. Here, I explore the intersection of LangChain, LLaMA, vector databases, and AI-powered automation, building real-world applications that demonstrate intelligent and interactive solutions.

## About Me 
I'm **Pavan Singh**, a passionate AI/ML engineer with a strong background in deep learning, natural language process, and AI model deployment. Over the past couple of years, I've worked on image classification, recommendation systems, data summarization, and AI powered tools. Currently, I'm focusing on Generative AI, large language models and langchain-based applications to solve practical problems efficiently.

## Projects
This repository contains several AI/ML projects leveraging LangChain and generative AI:
### 1️⃣ Cold Email Generator
- AI-powered system that reads job descriptions, analyzes your portfolio, and generates personalized cold emails.
- Utilizes LangChain, LLaMA models, ChromaDB, and JSON structured data to match your skills to job requirements.
- Optimized for semantic relevance and high-quality email generation.

Blog Generator Web App

### 2️ Blog Generator Web App
- Generates blogs from 300 to 2000 words based on user input.
- Supports custom tone selection (formal, casual, persuasive) for each blog.
- Built with Streamlit, LangChain, ChatGroq, and dotenv for secure API integration.

> More projects and self-learning experiments in LangChain & GenAI coming soon…
